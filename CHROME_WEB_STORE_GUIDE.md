# Chrome Web Store Publishing Guide

This guide walks you through publishing your Bookmark Sync Chrome extension to the Chrome Web Store.

## Prerequisites

Before you can publish to the Chrome Web Store, you need:

1. **Chrome Web Store Developer Account** ($5 one-time registration fee)
2. **Google Account** 
3. **Extension ready for distribution**
4. **Privacy Policy** (required for extensions requesting permissions)
5. **Screenshots and promotional materials**

## Step 1: Prepare Your Extension

### 1.1 Create Real Icons
The current icons are placeholders. You need actual PNG files:

```bash
# You need to create these icon files:
# - icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
# - icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
# - icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
# - icon128.png (128x128 pixels)
```

### 1.2 Update manifest.json
Ensure your manifest includes all required fields:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Bookmark Sync",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Save and sync your bookmarks to a centralized website",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "homepage_url": "https://your-website.com",
  // ... rest of manifest
}
```

### 1.3 Create a Privacy Policy
Required for extensions with permissions. Host it on your website or GitHub Pages.

## Step 2: Create Chrome Web Store Developer Account

1. Go to [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Pay the $5 one-time registration fee
4. Complete your developer profile

## Step 3: Package Your Extension

### Method 1: Zip File (Recommended)
```bash
cd /path/to/your/extension
zip -r bookmark-sync-extension.zip . -x "*.DS_Store" "node_modules/*" ".git/*"
```

### Method 2: Chrome Developer Mode
1. Open Chrome â†’ Extensions (`chrome://extensions/`)
2. Enable Developer Mode
3. Click "Pack extension"
4. Select your extension folder
5. Chrome creates a `.crx` file

## Step 4: Submit to Chrome Web Store

4. Provide contact information

## Step 5: Review Process
