**Last Updated:** August 21, 2025

## Overview

Bookmarkable ("we," "our," or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension handles your information.

## Information We Collect

### Data the Extension Accesses
- **Active Tab Information**: Only when you explicitly save a bookmark, we access:
  - Page title
  - Page URL
  - Page favicon (if available)
  - User-provided tags and descriptions

### Data We Do NOT Collect
- We do not collect personal information
- We do not track your browsing history
- We do not access tabs unless you explicitly save a bookmark
- We do not collect analytics or usage statistics
- We do not use cookies or tracking technologies

## How We Use Your Information

The information accessed by the extension is used solely to:
- Save bookmarks to your configured local server
- Display bookmark information in the extension popup
- Organize bookmarks with tags you provide

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
- All bookmark data is stored on your own local server
- No data is transmitted to our servers or third-party services
- You have complete control over your data storage location

### Data Security
- All communication between the extension and your local server occurs over HTTP/HTTPS
- No encryption is required as data remains within your local network
- You can delete all data at any time by clearing your local database

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or transfer your bookmark data to any third parties. Your bookmarks remain:
- On your local server only
- Under your complete control
- Never transmitted to external services

## Your Rights and Controls

You have the right to:
- **Access**: View all your saved bookmarks through the web interface
- **Export**: Export all your bookmarks in JSON format
- **Delete**: Remove individual bookmarks or clear all data
- **Control**: Disable or uninstall the extension at any time

## Permissions Explanation

The extension requests the following permissions:

### Required Permissions
- **`activeTab`**: To access the current page's title and URL when you save a bookmark
- **`storage`**: To remember your server configuration locally
- **`host_permissions`**: To communicate with your local bookmark server

### Why These Permissions Are Necessary
- We only access tab information when you explicitly click "Save Bookmark"
- Storage permission allows the extension to remember your server settings
- Host permissions enable communication with your local server
